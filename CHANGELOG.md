## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial crate skeleton: library and binary targets, CI pipeline, style
  configuration (clippy thresholds, strict lint table), and Makefile gates.
  Pinned by `tests/skeleton.rs`.
- Configuration loading (`DifftraceConfig`) from `~/.difftrace/config.toml`
  with typed errors; provider profile selection, `GitHub` endpoint override,
  and review tuning. Secrets are environment-only, never in the file. Pinned
  by the `config::tests` suite (defaults on empty and missing input, unknown
  profile rejection, partial-section defaults, round trip).
- Provider factory (`build_client`) mapping the configured profile onto
  loopctl's Anthropic and OpenAI clients via the statically dispatched
  `DifftraceClient` enum, with the `Ollama` profile riding the OpenAI
  protocol at a local endpoint; keys resolve from the environment only,
  empty strings counting as missing. Pinned by the `provider::tests` suite
  (per-profile construction, missing/empty key errors naming the variable,
  base-URL overrides on both profiles, Ollama model requirement).
- `GitHub` REST layer behind the `PrGateway` trait: pull request summary,
  raw diff fetch, file content at a ref, review-comment listing, and atomic
  review submission (summary + inline comments anchored with `line`/`side`)
  via octocrab. Pinned by the `github::tests` and `github::review::tests`
  suites (wire fixtures through real octocrab models, content decode
  including the above-1-MB rejection, the submission wire body built from
  the submission) and `tests/github_live.rs` behind `DIFFTRACE_E2E=1`.
- Unified-diff model: parser plus `DiffIndex` with `clamp_to_hunk`, the
  authority resolving a cited line to a comment-anchorable line and
  rejecting citations outside the changed hunks. Hunk headers whose declared
  counts the body contradicts fail the parse, as do body lines outside any
  hunk. Pinned by the `diff::parse::tests` suite (side numbering,
  consecutive-hunk renumbering, new/deleted/binary files, `--`-prefixed
  body lines, embedded ` b/` paths, count validation).
- Findings schema: `Findings` and `ReviewSummary` as loopctl
  `StructuredOutput` types with strict JSON Schemas and a closed four-level
  severity set. Pinned by the `findings::tests` suite (schema/serde mirror,
  round trips, unknown-severity rejection).
